# Deep-Learning-Image-Segmentation

In this project we have trained two models to predict car parts in photos of cars.
We use semantic image segmentation to label each pixel in the images.

The dataset is not included in this GitHub repository as it must be provided by Deloitte Consulting.

The models being trained is a U-Net model and a DeepLabV3+ model. 




The implementations of the models can be found in the following GitHub:

U-Net implementation: https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet/tree/master

DeepLabV3+ implementation: https://github.com/jfzhang95/pytorch-deeplab-xception/tree/master
